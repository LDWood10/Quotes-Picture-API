<h1># Quotes-Picture-API</h1>



<h2>How It's Made:</h2>

Tech Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript

One of my first API projects. I used two different APIs, one that generates a random quote and the other generates a random picture. Some of the combinations that are produced are quite laughable.

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>

As I noted above, this was one of the first API projects I completed. I wanted to challenge myself and use two different APIs instead of just one. This was a great learning experience for me as there was quite a bit of troublshooting and googling involved.
